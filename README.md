## Stefan Liute

Hey. I'm a newly-minted, full-stack junior developer in London, UK.

I'm the analytic type. I'm curious, so I learn a lot, all the time. I also make my team go round. I can spin a good story. All these things work from day one.

I love programming for the kind of challenges it offers: they're intellectual, social, diverse, multi-disciplinary and consequential. That's why I'm __so__ getting a job in the field. I'm thirsty, and there's a whole river in front of me.

Before this, I have been a brand strategist and (twice) agency co-founder. Both these agencies now thrive without my involvement, which is not the worst thing you could say about someone.

## Projects

Here are some of the things that made me happy while programming, before and during the Makers Academy pre-course. !!! TO BE UPDATED IN WEEK 10 !!!

| Project | Summary | Technologies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [projectSnitch](http://github.com/sliute/projectSnitch) | Using a Raspberry Pi and some simple wiring via its GPIO ports, I devised a very crude flooding detector (my home boiler is finicky). The detector is designed to turn on a LED (and potentially send a text) if water accumulates on my kitchen floor and thus closes an electrical circuit. | JavaScript, Cylon.js |
| [The Millionth Fibonacci Kata (Codewars)](https://github.com/sliute/codewars/blob/master/CW-22-themillionthfibonaccikata.rb) | While preparing for the pre-course, I took on a kata way above my current Codewars rank because I was fascinated by the mathematical apparatus behind it. I read about it in an MIT textbook, solved an equation and translated everything into working Ruby code. Note that the kata required an efficient algorithm, not just solving a problem. | Ruby |
| [Statistics for an Athletic Association (Codewars)](https://github.com/sliute/codewars/blob/master/CW-29-statisticsforanathleticassociation.rb) | This was one of my first katas done with pair programming. It wasn't particularly hard to solve, but the thought dynamics and the collaboration pair programming allows were a watershed moment. Working with someone else is so much more powerful and rewarding than working alone. I had a lot to learn from it. | Ruby, pair programming :smirk: |

## Skills

#### Strategy and analysis

I can easily assess, build or modify strategies. I can quickly go through large amounts of very diverse information, pinpoint key issues and design solutions.

#### Learning

I am always curious, and my curiosity is eclectic. I read fast and in large amounts. I learn from literally everyone around me, every day.

#### Teamwork

I have been part of teams large and small, I have seen them succeed or fail, and I strongly believe in the '1 + 1 = 3' paradigm. I prosper in team-centric environments because I am solution-oriented and people-oriented.

#### Communication

I can tell a good story, but I couldn't do it if I didn't know how to listen first. When I'm passionate about a topic, I can literally go on for hours and it is always a conversation, not a monologue.

#### Entrepreneurship

I co-founded [a branding and digital agency](http://www.grapefruit.ro), as well as [a pure-play branding consultancy](http://www.storience.com). My entrepreneurial drive comes from my inclination towards strategic thinking and teamwork.
