Hey.

I'm a newly-minted, full-stack junior developer in London, UK.

My team is my home, so I share everything and I do everything it takes to go round, always get better, and get things done. I'm the analytic type, but I can also tell a story. I'm curious, so I learn a lot, all the time. All these things work from day one.

I love programming for the kind of challenges it offers: they're intellectual, social, diverse, multi-disciplinary and consequential. That's why I'm _so_ getting a job in the field. I'm thirsty, and there's a whole river in front of me.

Before this, I have been a brand strategist and (twice) agency co-founder. I have been fortunate to be part of great teams in both cases, and these agencies now thrive without my involvement. Which is not the worst thing you could say about someone.

## Skills

#### Strategy and analysis

I can easily assess, build or modify strategies. I can quickly go through large amounts of very diverse information, pinpoint key issues and design solutions.

#### Learning

I am always curious, and my curiosity is eclectic. I read fast and in large amounts. I learn from literally everyone around me, every day.

#### Teamwork

I have been part of teams large and small, I have seen them succeed or fail, and I strongly believe in the '1 + 1 = 3' paradigm. I prosper in team-centric environments because I am solution-oriented and people-oriented.

#### Communication

I can tell a good story, but I couldn't do it if I didn't know how to listen first. When I'm passionate about a topic, I can literally go on for hours and it is always a conversation, not a monologue.

#### Entrepreneurship

I co-founded [a branding and digital agency](http://www.grapefruit.ro), as well as [a pure-play branding consultancy](http://www.storience.com). My entrepreneurial drive comes from my inclination towards strategic thinking and teamwork.
