## Stefan Liute

I am a brand strategist and twice co-founder turned Junior Developer. A collaborative, multi-disciplinary, human-centred view of the future drives me, and I am very much in love with what I do.

Having just completed the 4-week pre-course at [Makers Academy](http://github.com/makersacademy), my passion for programming has blossomed. It is now more focused and encompasses much more than simply writing code that runs. But we'll see if it and I survive the upcoming 12-week course :smirk:

After I graduate the Makers Academy at the end of March 2017, I will begin a career in software development in London. Ideally, I will work somewhere I can learn all the time. I dream of contributing to technology that changes people's lives for the better.

## Projects

Here are some of the things that made me happy while programming, before and during the Makers Academy pre-course.

| Project | Summary | Technologies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [projectSnitch](http://github.com/sliute/projectSnitch) | Using a Raspberry Pi and some simple wiring via its GPIO ports, I devised a very crude flooding detector (my home boiler is finicky). The detector is designed to turn on a LED (and potentially send a text) if water accumulates on my kitchen floor and thus closes an electrical circuit. | JavaScript, Cylon.js |
| [The Millionth Fibonacci Kata (Codewars)](https://github.com/sliute/codewars/blob/master/CW-22-themillionthfibonaccikata.rb) | While preparing for the pre-course, I took on a kata way above my current Codewars rank because I was fascinated by the mathematical apparatus behind it. I read about it in an MIT textbook, solved an equation and translated everything into working Ruby code. Note that the kata required an efficient algorithm, not just solving a problem. | Ruby |
| [Statistics for an Athletic Association (Codewars)](https://github.com/sliute/codewars/blob/master/CW-29-statisticsforanathleticassociation.rb) | This was one of my first katas done with pair programming. It wasn't particularly hard to solve, but the thought dynamics and the collaboration pair programming allows were a watershed moment. Working with someone else is so much more powerful and rewarding than working alone. I had a lot to learn from it. | Ruby, pair programming :smirk: |

## Skills

#### Strategy and analysis

I can easily assess, build or modify business and communication strategies. I can quickly go through large amounts of very diverse information, pinpoint the key issues and design a sound solution to a concrete problem. This has always come naturally to me. Now, after 17 years and several hundred projects, it is even easier, yet no less captivating.

I have done strategy work for technology, professional services, healthcare, retail, consumer, education, public sector, non-profit, energy, manufacturing and construction brands and institutions from Europe and the United States.

#### Learning

I am always curious, and my curiosity is eclectic. I read fast and in large amounts, with a healthy balance of fiction and non-fiction. I love to work next to people who are smarter or more experienced than I am, because they are a superb source of knowledge. But I learn from literally everyone around me, every day.

My inclination for learning is what allows me to change course quickly and effectively in my professional life. I started as a medical doctor, then became a brand strategist, and I am now a junior developer. I believe a multi-disciplinary professional can bring a lot of value, wherever they choose to work, as cross-pollination across different realms of thought is a major source of creativity.

#### Teamwork

Everything I achieved in my professional life, I did it with one or more people around me. I have been part of teams large and small, I have seen them succeed or fail, and I strongly believe in the '1 + 1 = 3' paradigm. I have built and rebuilt teams (from 3 to 25 people) and yes, that means hiring, coaching, mentoring or firing. I am very proud to have kick-started several people's careers in marketing and communication.

I have worked in cross-organisational setups (usually client-provider ones) and I am familiar with the dynamics of these relationships. I prosper in team environments because I am solution-oriented and people-oriented. Power play is of little interest to me, and I have a rather equalitarian perspective on work relationships.

#### Communication

I can tell a good story, but I couldn't do it if I didn't know how to listen first. I regularly held business presentation (some even in antagonistic circumstances!), spoke in public, wrote for trade publications, taught and trained people. When I'm passionate about a topic, I can literally go on for hours, with or without a script, and it is always a conversation, not a monologue.

#### Entrepreneurship

I co-founded [a branding and digital agency](http://www.grapefruit.ro), as well as [a pure-play branding consultancy](http://www.storience.com). Most of my customers have been entrepreneurs themselves. The strategy and communication work I did propelled most them to significant business achievements such as growth, expansion, successful exits, turnarounds etc.

My entrepreneurial spirit derives from my inclination towards strategic thinking and teamwork. In turn, it fostered adaptation and flexibility (whoever heard of change-fearing entrepreneurs?), as well as commitment to a purpose and to the people who choose to pursue it with you. In plain English, that's doggedness and loyalty.
